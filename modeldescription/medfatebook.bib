abstract = {Increasing drought is one of the most critical challenges facing species and ecosystems worldwide, and improved theory and practices are needed for quantification of species tolerances. Leaf water potential at turgor loss, or wilting ($\pi$(tlp) ), is classically recognised as a major physiological determinant of plant water stress response. However, the cellular basis of $\pi$(tlp) and its importance for predicting ecological drought tolerance have been controversial. A meta-analysis of 317 species from 72 studies showed that $\pi$(tlp) was strongly correlated with water availability within and across biomes, indicating power for anticipating drought responses. We derived new equations giving both $\pi$(tlp) and relative water content at turgor loss point (RWC(tlp) ) as explicit functions of osmotic potential at full turgor ($\pi$(o) ) and bulk modulus of elasticity ($\epsilon$). Sensitivity analyses and meta-analyses showed that $\pi$(o) is the major driver of $\pi$(tlp) . In contrast, $\epsilon$ plays no direct role in driving drought tolerance within or across species, but sclerophylly and elastic adjustments act to maintain RWC(tlp,) preventing cell dehydration, and additionally protect against nutrient, mechanical and herbivory stresses independent of drought tolerance. These findings clarify biogeographic trends and the underlying basis of drought tolerance parameters with applications in comparative assessments of species and ecosystems worldwide.},

abstract = {Predicting the environmental responses of leaf photosynthesis is central to many models of changes in the future global carbon cycle and terrestrial biosphere. The steady-state biochemical model of C-3 photosynthesis of Farquhar et al. (Planta 149, 78-90, 1980) provides a basis for these larger scale predictions; but a weakness in the application of the model as currently parameterized is the inability to accurately predict carbon assimilation at the range of temperatures over which significant photosynthesis occurs in the natural environment. The temperature functions used in this model have been based on in vitro measurements made over a limited temperature range and require several assumptions of in vivo conditions. Since photosynthetic rates are often Rubisco-limited (ribulose, 1-5 bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) under natural steady-state conditions, inaccuracies in the functions predicting Rubisco kinetic properties at different temperatures may cause significant error. In this study, transgenic tobacco containing only 10{\%} normal levels of Rubisco were used to measure Rubisco-limited photosynthesis over a large range of CO2 concentrations. From the responses of the rate of CO2 assimilation at a wide range of temperatures, and CO2 and O-2 concentrations, the temperature functions of Rubisco kinetic properties were estimated in vivo. These differed substantially from previously published functions. These new functions were then used to predict photosynthesis in lemon and found to faithfully mimic the observed pattern of temperature response. There was also a close correspondence with published C-3 photosynthesis temperature responses. The results represent an improved ability to model leaf photosynthesis over a wide range of temperatures (10-40 degreesC) necessary for predicting carbon uptake by terrestrial C-3 systems.},

@article{Collatz1991,
abstract = {This paper presents a system of models for the simulation of gas and energy exchange of a leaf of a C3 plant in free air. The physiological processes are simulated by sub-models that: (a) give net photosynthesis (An) as a function of environmental and leaf parameters and stomatal conductance (gs); (b) give g, as a function of the concentration of CO2 and H2O in air at the leaf surface and the current rate of photosynthesis of the leaf. An energy balance and mass transport sub-model is used to couple the physiological processes through a variable boundary layer to the ambient environment. The models are based on theoretical and empirical analysis of gs, and An measured at the leaf level, and tests with intact attached leaves of soybeans show very good agreement between predicted and measured responses of gs and An over a wide range of leaf temperatures (20-35??C), CO2 concentrations (10-90 Pa), air to leaf water vapor deficits (0.5-3.7 kPa) and light intensities (100-2000 ??mol m-2s-1). The combined models were used to simulate the responses of latent heat flux (??E) and gs for a soybean canopy for the course of an idealized summer day, using the 'big-leaf' approximation. Appropriate data are not yet available to provide a rigorous test of these simulations, but the response patterns are similar to field observations. These simulations show a pronounced midday depression of ??E and gs at low or high values of boundary-layer conductance. Deterioration of plant water relations during midday has often been invoked to explain this common natural phenomenon, but the present models do not consider this possibility. Analysis of the model indicates that the simulated midday depression is, in part, the result of positive feedback mediated by the boundary layer. For example, a change in gs affects An and ??E. As a consequence, the temperature, humidity and CO2 concentration of the air in the proximity of the stomata (e.g. the air at the leaf surface) change and these, in turn, affect gs. The simulations illustrate the possible significance of the boundary layer in mediating feedback loops which affect the regulation of stomatal conductance and ??E. The simulations also examine the significance of changing the response properties of the photosynthetic component of the model by changing leaf protein content or the CO2 concentration of the atmosphere. ?? 1991.},

abstract = {A numerical process-based model of terrestrial ecosystem dynamics is described and tested. The model, Hybrid v3.0, treats the daily cycling of carbon, nitrogen, and water within the biosphere and between the biosphere and the atmosphere. It combines a mass-balance approach with the capacity to predict the relative dominance of different species or generalised plant types (such as evergreen needleleaved trees, cold deciduous broadleaved trees, and C3 grasses). The growth of individual trees is simulated on an annual timestep, and the growth of a grass layer is simulated on a daily timestep. The exchange of carbon, nitrogen, and water with the atmosphere and the soil is simulated on a daily timestep (except the flux of tree litter to the soil, which occurs annually). Individual trees and the grass layer compete with each other for light, water, and nitrogen within a 'plot'. Larger and taller plants shade smaller ones; they also take up a greater proportion of the available water and nitrogen. The above-ground space in each plot is divided into 1 m deep layers for the purposes of calculating irradiance interception; horizontal variation in the plot environment is not treated. The soil is represented as a single layer, with a daily hydrological budget. Decomposition of soil organic matter is calculated using an empirical sub-model. The initial size of each tree seedling is stochastic. To predict the mean behaviour of the model for a particular boundary condition it is necessary to simulate a number of plots. Hybrid v3.0 has been written with three major requirements in mind: (i) the carbon, water, and nutrient cycles must be fully coupled in the soil-plant-atmosphere system; (ii) the internal constraints on the model's behaviour, and the driving forces for the model, must be the same as those which operate in nature (e.g., climate, nitrogen deposition, and the atmospheric concentrations of CO 2 and 02); and (iii) the model must be constructed so that it is capable of predicting transient as well as equilibrium responses to climate change. These conditions have largely been met by constructing the model around a set of fundamental hypotheses regarding the general constraints under which plants and soils behave, independently of any particular location or time. The model is thus potentially capable of making reliable predictions of ecosystem behaviour and structure under future, new, amaospheric conditions. The model is tested for a site in eastern North America. A quasi-equilibrium is reached after approximately 250 years with 10 plots. It is found that more plots are not necessary in order to obtain a reliable estimate of mean behaviour. Predictions of productivity, leaf area index, foliage nitrogen, soil carbon, and biomass carbon are all within the range expected for this location.},

abstract = {Embolisms decrease plant hydraulic conductance and therefore reduce the ability of the xylem to transport water to leaves provided that embolized conduits are not refilled. However, as a xylem conduit is filled with gas during cavitation, water is freed to the transpiration stream and this transiently increases xylem water potential. This capacitive effect of embolism formation on plant function has not been explicitly quantified in the past. A dynamic model is presented that models xylem water potential, xylem sap flow and cavitation, taking into account both the decreasing hydraulic conductance and the water release effect of xylem embolism. The significance of the capacitive effect increases in relation to the decreasing hydraulic conductance effect when transpiration rate is low in relation to the total amount of water in xylem conduits. This ratio is typically large in large trees and during drought.},

We examined this premise by coupling a meta-analysis of functional traits of stomatal response 14 to drought (i.e. the water potential causing stomatal closure, $\psi$close) and embolism resistance (the water 15 potential at the onset of embolism formation, $\Psi$12), with simulations from a soil-plant hydraulic model. 16 We found that $\psi$close and $\Psi$12 were equal (isometric) only for a restricted number of species, but as $\Psi$12 17 decreases, the departure from isometry increases, with stomatal closure occurring far before embolism 18 occurs. For the most drought resistant species ($\Psi$12{\textless}-4.2 MPa), $\Psi$close was remarkably independent of 19 embolism resistance and remained above -4.5 MPa, suggesting the existence of a restrictive boundary 20 by which stomata closure must occur. This pattern was supported by model simulations. Indeed, 21 coordinated decrease in both $\psi$close and $\psi$12 leads to unsuspected accelerated death under drought for 22 embolism resistant species, in contradiction with observations from drought mortality experiments. 23 Overall our results highlight that most species have similarity in stomatal behavior, and are highly 24 conservative in terms of their water use during drought. The modelling framework presented here 25 provides a baseline to simulate the temporal dynamic leading to mortality under drought by accounting 26 for multiple, measurable traits. 27 28 29 30 31 .

abstract = {A process-based model is described and applied to a range of Pinus radiata D. Don stands, aged 9-12 years, growing on stabilised sand dunes in a stocking ?? fertiliser experiment in Woodhill State Forest, New Zealand. The model requires inputs of daily weather data (maximum and minimum air temperatures and rainfall), physical characteristics of the site (longitude, latitude, rootzone depth and relationship between root-zone soil matric potential and volumetric water-content) and crop (stocking, crown dimensions and leaf-area index) and crop physiological parameters (e.g., maximum stomatal conductance). The model was used to simulate components of the forest water-balance and annual net photosynthesis for a defined crop canopy architecture. Simulated daily root-zone water storage in both open and closed canopy stands generally agreed with monthly measurements made over a complete year. Simulated net annual photosynthesis ranged from 23 to 33 t C ha-1 year-1 and comparison with measured stem-volume increments of 12-38 m3 ha-1 year-1 over the same time periods resulted in a strong positive correlation. Ratios of stem-volume increment to net photosynthesis suggested that fertilised and unfertilised stands had a 26 and 14{\%}, respetively, allocation of C to stem growth. Simulations using weather data for a dry year with 941 mm year-1 rainfall indicated that annual net photosynthesis and transpiration of fully stocked stands were reduced by 41 and 45{\%}, respectively, compared to those in a wet year with 153 mm year-1 rainfall. Operational applications of the model to forest management in quantifying environmental requirements for stand growth and examining silvicultural alternatives are discussed. ?? 1990.},

@article{Medlyn2002,
abstract = {Responses of plant processes to temperature may vary according to the time scale on which they are measured. In this study, both short-term and seasonal responses of photosynthesis to temperature were examined. A field study of seasonal changes in the temperature response of photosynthesis was conducted on two provenances, French and Moroccan, of mature maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.). Measurements were made every 2 months over a 1-year period and used to parameterize a mechanistic model of photosynthesis. Temperature responses of maximum Rubisco activity, Vcmax, and potential electron transport rate, Jmax, were obtained for each measurement period, as was the response of stomatal conductance, gs, to water vapour pressure deficit (VPD). Absolute values of Vcmax and Jmax at 25 °C were related to needle nitrogen content, Narea.Narea, and thus Vcmax and Jmax, were negatively correlated with the mean minimum temperature in the month preceding measurements. The ratio of Jmax : Vcmax at 25 °C varied between 1 and 1{\textperiodcentered}7 but did not show any seasonal trend. Nor was there any seasonal trend in the relative temperature response of Vcmax, which had an activation energy Ha of approximately 57 kJ mol−1 throughout the experiment. The activation energy of Jmax was also close to constant throughout the experiment, averaging 39 kJ mol−1. For the French provenance, the optimal temperature of Jmax was positively correlated with the maximum temperature of the previous day, but no such correlation was found for the Moroccan provenance. The response of gs to VPD also varied seasonally, with much stronger stomatal closure in winter months. Taken together, these results implied a translational shift downwards of the photosynthetic temperature response curve with increasing Tprev, and a shift in the temperature optimum of photosynthesis of 5–10 °C between summer and winter. These results illustrate that the short-term temperature response of photosynthesis varies significantly on a seasonal basis.},

abstract = {I. II. III. IV. V. VI. VII. VIII. References Summary Climate change exposes vegetation to unusual drought, causing declines in productivity and increased mortality. Drought responses are hard to anticipate because canopy transpiration and diffusive conductance (G) respond to drying soil and vapor pressure deficit (D) in complex ways. A growing database of hydraulic traits, combined with a parsimonious theory of tree water transport and its regulation, may improve predictions of at-risk vegetation. The theory uses the physics of flow through soil and xylem to quantify how canopy water supply declines with drought and ceases by hydraulic failure. This transpiration ‘supply function' is used to predict a water ‘loss function' by assuming that stomatal regulation exploits transport capacity while avoiding failure. Supply–loss theory incorporates root distribution, hydraulic redistribution, cavitation vulnerability, and cavitation reversal. The theory efficiently defines stomatal responses to D, drying soil, and hydraulic vulnerability. Driving the theory with climate predicts drought-induced loss of plant hydraulic conductance (k), canopy G, carbon assimilation, and productivity. Data lead to the ‘chronic stress hypothesis' wherein {\textgreater} 60{\%} loss of k increases mortality by multiple mechanisms. Supply–loss theory predicts the climatic conditions that push vegetation over this risk threshold. The theory's simplicity and predictive power encourage testing and application in large-scale modeling.},

abstract = {Ecosystem models have difficulty predicting plant drought responses, partially from uncer-tainty in the stomatal response to water deficits in soil and atmosphere. We evaluate a 'sup-ply–demand' theory for water-limited stomatal behavior that avoids the typical scaffold of empirical response functions. The premise is that canopy water demand is regulated in pro-portion to threat to supply posed by xylem cavitation and soil drying. The theory was implemented in a trait-based soil–plant–atmosphere model. The model pre-dicted canopy transpiration (E), canopy diffusive conductance (G), and canopy xylem pressure (P canopy) from soil water potential (P soil) and vapor pressure deficit (D). Modeled responses to D and P soil were consistent with empirical response functions, but controlling parameters were hydraulic traits rather than coefficients. Maximum hydraulic and diffusive conductances and vulnerability to loss in hydraulic conductance dictated stomatal sensitivity and hence the iso-to anisohydric spectrum of regulation. The model matched wide fluctuations in G and P canopy across nine data sets from seasonally dry tropical forest and pi{\~{}} non–juniper woodland with {\textless} 26{\%} mean error. Promising initial performance suggests the theory could be useful in improving ecosystem models. Better understanding of the variation in hydraulic properties along the root–stem–leaf continuum will simplify parameterization.},

abstract = {A range of continental-scale soil datasets exists in Europe with different spatial representation and based on different principles. We developed comprehensive pedotransfer functions (PTFs) for applications principally on spatial datasets with continental coverage. The PTF development included the prediction of soil water retention at various matric potentials and prediction of parameters to characterize soil moisture retention and the hydraulic conductivity curve (MRC and HCC) of European soils. We developed PTFs with a hierarchical approach, determined by the input requirements. The PTFs were derived by using three statistical methods: (i) linear regression where there were quantitative input variables, (ii) a regression tree for qualitative, quantitative and mixed types of information and (iii) mean statistics of developer-defined soil groups (class PTF) when only qualitative input parameters were available. Data of the recently established European Hydropedological Data Inventory (EU-HYDI), which holds the most comprehensive geographical and thematic coverage of hydro-pedological data in Europe, were used to train and test the PTFs. The applied modelling techniques and the EU-HYDI allowed the development of hydraulic PTFs that are more reliable and applicable for a greater variety of input parameters than those previously available for Europe. Therefore the new set of PTFs offers tailored advanced tools for a wide range of applications in the continent.},

abstract = {Water-storage capacity was measured in Thuja occidentalis L., Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carr., and Acer saccharum Marsh. during the dehydration of stem segments 1.5-2.5 cm in diameter. Stem water potential was measured with a temperature-corrected stem hygrometer and cavitations were detected acoustically. Water loss was measured by weight change. Dehydration isotherms consistently displayed three phases. The first phase, from water potential ($\Psi$) 0 to about -0.2 MPa, had a high capacitance (C{\textgreater}0.4kg water lost{\textperiodcentered} (1 of tissue)-1{\textperiodcentered} MPa-1) and we have attributed this high C to capillary water as defined by Zimmermann (1983, Xylem structure and the ascent of sap, Springer-Verlag). The second phase from $\Psi$=-0.5 to about -2.0 had the lowest C values ({\textless}0.02 kg{\textperiodcentered}l-1{\textperiodcentered}MPa-1) and was accompanied by a few cavitation events. This phase may have been a transition zone between capillary storage and water released by cavitation events as well as water drawn from living cells of the bark. The third phase also had a high C (about 0.07-0.22kg{\textperiodcentered}l-1{\textperiodcentered}MPa-1) and was associated with many cavitation events while $\Psi$ declined below about -2.5 MPa; we presume the high capacitance was the consequence of water released by cavitation events. We discuss the ecological adaptive advantage of these three phases of water-storage in trees. In moist environments, water withdrawn from capillary storage may be an important fraction of transpiration, but may be of little adaptive advantage. For most of the growth season trees draw mainly on elastic storage, but stem elastic storage is less than leaf elastic storage and therefore unlikely to be important. In very dry environments, water relased by cavitation events might be important to the short-term survival of trees. {\textcopyright} 1990 Springer-Verlag.},
