However, uncertainties in how ecological systems function and practical constraints in how to integrate available information prevent the development of robust and reliable predictive models. Despite the amount of knowledge accumulated about the functioning and dynamics of Mediterranean forests, scientists should make coordinate their efforts to address the challenge of integrating the different global change drivers in a modelling framework useful for research and applications. The R package medfate has been designed to simulate the functioning and dynamics of Mediterranean forest stands at temporal scales from days to years. Fire and drought impacts are the main subjects covered by the package. Eco-hydrological processes are fundamental for the simulation models included in the package. In particular, the package allows the simulation of water balance of soils and plants within forest stands. It also allows simulating plant growth of a set of cohorts competing for light and water within a forest stand. Finally, the package also includes functions to relate the amount of plant biomass and the relative water content of plant tissues to live fuel moisture content, hence, fire hazard. The version of the reference manual that you are reading is intended to reflect version 0.8.2 of the package. 1.2 Package installation Package medfate can be found at CRAN, where it is updated every few months. Hence, it can be installed using: install.packages(&quot;medfate&quot;) Users can also download and install the latest stable versions GitHub as follows (required package devtools should be installed/updated first): devtools::install_github(&quot;miquelcaceres/medfate&quot;) When installing from GitHub, may need to force the installation of package vignettes, by using: devtools::install_github(&quot;miquelcaceres/medfate&quot;, build_opts = c(&quot;--no-resave-data&quot;, &quot;--no-manual&quot;)) 1.3 Package functions 1.3.1 Dynamic simulation functions Soil water balance can be studied for a given forest stand using function spwb(), with the following purposes: Monitor or forecast temporal variation in soil water content in particular stands (for example to estimate mushroom yield). Monitor or forecast temporal variation of plant drought stress in particular stands (for example to anticipate mortality events). Monitor or forecast temporal variation of fuel moisture in particular stands (for example to monitor wildfire risk). Changes in leaf area and plant growth are key to evaluate the influence of climatic conditions on forest structure and function. Function growth() allows simulating growth of a set of plant cohorts competing for light and water in a given forest stand, with the following purposes: Monitor or forecast temporal variation in water fluxes and soil water content in forest stands (for example to estimate regulation ecosystem services) taking into account processes determining leaf area changes and plant growth. Monitor or forecast temporal variation of plant size (i.e. growth) in forest stands. Monitor or forecast temporal variation of live fuel moisture and the amount of standing dead and live fuels in forest stands (for example to monitor wildfire risk). 1.3.2 Sub-model functions Many of the functions included in medfate are internally called by simulation functions. Some of them are made available to the user, to facilitate understanding the different sub-models and to facilitate a more creative use of the package. Sub-model functions are grouped by subject, which is included in the name of the function. The different sub-model functions are (by subject): biophysics_*: Physical and biophysical utility functions. hydraulics_*: Plant hydraulics. hydrology_*: Canopy and soil hydrology (rainfall interception, soil evaporation, soil infiltration). light_*: Light extinction and absortion. moisture_*: Live tissue moisture. pheno_*: Leaf phenology. photo_*: Leaf photosynthesis. root_*: Root distribution and conductance calculations. soil_*: Soil hydraulics and thermodynamics. spwb_*: Soil water balance parameter optimization/calibration routines. transp_*: Stomatal regulation and resulting transpiration/photosynthesis. 1.3.3 Static functions Package medfate include a number of functions to examine properties of the plants conforming forests, summary functions at the stand level or vertical profiles of several physical properties: plant_*: Cohort-level information (species name, id, leaf area, heightâ€¦). species_*: Cohort-level attributes aggregated by species (e.g. basal area). forest_*: Forest-level attributes (e.g. basal area). vprofile_*: Vertical profiles (light, wind, fuel density, leaf area density). Vegetation functioning and dynamics have strong, but complex, effects on fire hazard. On one hand, growth and death of organs and individuals changes the amount of standing live and dead fuels, as well as downed dead fuels. On the other, day-to-day changes in soil and plant water content changes the physical properties of fuel, notably fuel moisture content. Package medfate provides functions to estimate fuel properties and potential fire behaviour in forest inventory plots. Specifically, function fuel_stratification() provides a stratification of the stand into understory and canopy strata; and fuel_FCCS() calculates fuel characteristics. Function fuel_cohortFineFMC() allows obtaining daily fuel moisture content estimates corresponding to the water status of plants, as returned by function spwb(). A fire behaviour model is implemented in function fire_FCCS() to calculate the intensity of surface fire reaction and the rate of fire spread of surface fires assuming a steady-state fire. Fuel and fire behaviour functions allow obtaining the following: Fuel characteristics by stratum. Surface fire behavior (i.e. reaction intensity, rate of spread, fireline intensity and flame length). Crown fire behavior. Fire potential ratings of surface fire behavior and crown fire behavior. 1.4 How to use this book This is a reference book for simulation and static models included in medfate. Hands-on user guides to run simulation functions and static functions can be found as package vignettes within the package. Our aim is to continuously update the reference book along with package developments, so that users have detailed information about the models at the time functions are run. As the manual will follow package updates, after a given model application users should store a PDF version of the reference manual to be sure it matches the version the package reported in their application report or article. The following chapter describes the soil, vegetation and meteorology inputs that apply to all models. After that, the book presents each simulation model using a set of chapters. The first chapter introduces the model and the remaining describe the details of formulations by processes. Those process formulations that are common to more than one model (like hydrology) are described only once. Static models and their functions are presented grouped at the end of the book, before the appendices. In this book we use objectname or variablename to indicate R code or to refer to an R objects or a variable within data frames, and functionname() to refer to a package function. When relevant, we indicate the correspondence between mathematical symbols, their units and names within R. "]
