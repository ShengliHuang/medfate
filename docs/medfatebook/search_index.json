(in prep.), that shares some characteristics with the basic water balance model described in previous chapters (namely, phenological and hydrological processes), but adds substantial detail in plant hydraulics and photosynthesis. As in chapter {#basicwaterbalance}, we provide an overview of the model in the present chapter and the following ones provide a much deeper understanding on model details. We recommend users to familiarize with basic water balance modelling processes before reading this and the subsequent chapters. 7.1 Design principles The model performs soil water balance and energy balance for a given forest stand and for the period corresponding to input weather data. Soil water balance is calculated on a daily step basis whereas radiation and energy balances are performed in subdaily steps (usually 1 hour). Like the basic water balance mdoel, this model considers only the vertical spatial dimension of the stand, and not the horizontal distribution of plants within it. Still, the stand is divided into plant cohorts of different species, height and leaf area index (\\(LAI\\)). Hydrological processes are the almost same as in the basic water balance. The model includes water interception loss (Gash, Lloyd, and Lachaud 1995), plant transpiration, evaporation from soil (Ritchie 1972) and the partition between infiltration and runoff (Boughton 1989). Water exceeding soil water holding capacity is lost via deep drainage. For plant transpiration, the model determines subdaily regulation of leaf water conductance and actual transpiration involving detailed calculations of hydraulics and photosynthesis (Sperry et al. 2016). This level of complexity allows a precise estimation of photosynthesis and hydraulic redistribution of water among soil layers. As mentioned above, radiation and energy balances are conducted subdaily at two levels: canopy/soil and leaf. One one hand the model keeps track of temperature variation of the air in the canopy (i.e. canopy energy balance) and in the soil (i.e. soil energy balance) as the result of energy exchanges between them and with the atmosphere. These energy balance equations are very similar to those of Best et al. (2011) for model JULES. On the other, the model performs the energy balance at the leaf level to determine transpiration (Sperry et al. 2016). At this scale, radiation inputs include shortwave radiation from the atmosphere absorbed by the leaf and absorbed longwave radiation coming from both the atmosphere and the canopy itself. Leaf temperature is determined assuming that the temperature of the air is that of the canopy. After performing stomatal regulation, the model upscales the transpiration flux to the canopy scale and the corresponding latent heat is used to complete the calculation of the energy balance at the canopy level. Latent heat fluxes from evaporation from the soil and evaporation of intercepted rainfall are also included in the energy balance. 7.2 State variables The model has the following state variables: + Cumulative growth degree days, \\(GDD\\), are tracked by the model and determine leaf phenological status of winter deciduous species. + Daily soil moisture content dynamics on each layer \\(s\\) are tracked using \\(W = \\theta(\\Psi_s)/ \\theta_{fc,s}\\), the proportion of volumetric soil moisture in relation to field capacity, where field capacity, \\(\\theta_{fc,s}\\), is assumed to correspond to \\(\\Psi_{fc} = -0.033\\) MPa. Soils are not allowed to contain more water than dictated by their field capacity. + The temperature of the canopy and of each soil layer (\\(T_c\\) and \\(T_s\\); both in ºC) are tracked for every subdaily step. + If irreversible cavitation is activated, the model also tracks \\(P_{embolized,i}\\), the maximum value of daily drought stress so far experienced. 7.3 Water and energy balances 7.3.1 Water balance Daily variations in soil water content (\\(\\Delta{V_{soil}}\\) in \\(mm\\)) can be summarized as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\Delta{V_{soil}} = Pr + Sm - In - Ru - Dd - Es -Tr \\end{equation}\\] where \\(Pr\\) is precipitation as rainfall, \\(Sm\\) is water from melting the snow pack (if considered), \\(In\\) is the interception loss (i.e., water evaporated after being intercepted by the canopy), \\(Ru\\) is surface runoff, \\(Dd\\) is deep drainage (i.e. water percolated to layers beyond soil depth), \\(Es\\) is evaporation from soil and \\(Tr\\) is plant transpiration. If snow dynamics are considered, the water balance of the snow pack is defined as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\Delta{S_{snow}} = Ps - Sm \\end{equation}\\] where \\(Ps\\) is precipitation as snowfall and \\(Sm\\) is snow melt. 7.3.2 Energy balance The canopy absorbs shortwave radiation from the atmosphere (\\(K_{abs,ca}\\)). It also absorbs longwave counterradiation from the atmosphere (\\(L_{abs,ca}\\)) and longwave radiation emmited from the soil (\\(L_{abs,cs}\\)). These inputs are counterbalanced by the longwave radiation emmited by the canopy (\\(L_{em,c}\\)) in both cases. Other energy fluxes considered are convective exchanges between the canopy and atmosphere (\\(H_{ca}\\)) and between the canopy and the soil (\\(H_{cs}\\)). Finally, energy is released to the atmosphere through latent heat (\\(LE_{c}\\)) produced via transpiration (so far, interception and soil evaporation are not included). The instantaneous energy balance equation for the canopy is thus: \\[\\begin{equation} C_{c} \\cdot \\frac{\\delta T_{c}}{\\delta t} = K_{abs,ca} + (L_{abs,ca} - L_{em,c}) + (L_{abs,cs} - L_{em,c}) - LE_{c} - H_{ca} - H_{cs} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(C_{c}\\) is the canopy thermal capacitance. Like the canopy, the soil absorbs short- and longwave radiation from the atmosphere (\\(K_{abs,sa}\\) and \\(L_{abs,sa}\\)). It also absorbs longwave radiation released by the canopy (\\(L_{abs,sc} = L_{em,c}\\)) and emmits longwave radiation (\\(L_{em,s}\\)). Note that \\(L_{abs,cs} \\leq L_{em,s}\\) because part of the radiation emmitted by the soil is sent to the atmosphere without being intercepted by the canopy. Finally, it also exchanges convective energy with the canopy (\\(H_{cs}\\)). The energy balance equation for the soil is: \\[\\begin{equation} C_{s} \\cdot \\frac{\\delta T_{s}}{\\delta t} = K_{abs,sa} + L_{abs,sa} - L_{em,s} + L_{abs,sc} + H_{cs} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(C_{s}\\) is the soil thermal capacitance. 7.4 Process scheduling Every day the model performs the following actions: Update leaf area values according to the phenology of species. Increase soil moisture due to precipitation after accounting for canopy interception loss, surface runoff and deep drainage. Determine subdaily temperature and direct/diffuse irradiance variations. Determine short- and longwave radiation absorved by the canopy and the soil at subdaily steps. Determine plant transpiration, photosynthesis and close soil/canopy energy balance at subdaily steps. This involves the following sub-actions: Determine longwave radiation emmited by soil and canopy, according to their temperature. Update the water supply function of each plant cohort, according to the hydraulic model and the current soil water potential. Calculate leaf temperature and photosynthesis, for shade and sunlit leaves of each plant cohort, corresponding to each transpiration value of the supply function. Determine stomatal conductance, transpiration and photosynthesis on shade and sunlit leaves of each plant cohort according to a profit maximization strategy. Update soil moisture after scaling transpiration from leaf to canopy level. Complete energy balance of the canopy and the soil (after translating plant transpiration to latent heat and calculating convective heat exchange for both the canopy and the soil). Determine drought stress index for each plant cohort. Decrease water content due to bare soil evaporation, closing the water balance. 7.5 Inputs and outputs 7.5.1 Soil, vegetation and meteorology Soil Soil input requirements are the same as for the basic water balance model and are fully described in section 2.1. In this model, however, only Genuchten (1980) water retention curves are available. Vegetation Vegetation input requirements are fully described in section 2.2. Trees and shrubs do not need to be distinguished in soil water balance calculations, since both kinds of cohort have a \\(LAI\\) value. In most cases, users only need to estimate the leaf area index corresponding to live leaves, i.e. \\(LAI^{live}\\), because normally at the starting point all leaves are expanded (i.e. \\(LAI^{\\phi} = LAI^{live}\\)) and one can assume no dead leaves in the canopy (i.e., \\(LAI^{dead} = 0\\)). Vegetation characteristics stay constant during simulations using function spwb(), although the actual expanded leaf area (\\(LAI^{\\phi}\\)) and dead leaf area may vary is the species is winter deciduous. Meteorology The minimum weather variables required to run the model are min/max temperatures (\\(T_{min}\\) and \\(T_{max}\\)), min/max relative humidity (\\(RH_{min}\\) and \\(RH_{max}\\)), precipitation (\\(P\\)) and solar radiation (\\(Rad\\)). Wind speed (\\(u\\)) is also needed for the model, but the user ma introduce missing values if not available (then, a default value will be used). Definitions and units of these variables are given in section 2.3. 7.5.2 Species parameters Vegetation functional attributes are normally filled for each cohort by function spwbInput() from species identity.
