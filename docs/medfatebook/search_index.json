Specifying a deep rocky layer is important because Mediterranean plants may extend their roots into cracks existing in the parent rock (Ruffault et al. 2013). In medfate, soils can be described using between 1 and 5 soil layers. For each soil layer \\(s\\) the following physical parameters are needed: \\(d_{s}\\) [widths]: Soil layer width (in mm). \\(P_{clay,s}\\) [clay]: Percent of clay. \\(P_{sand,s}\\) [sand]: Percent of sand. \\(OM\\) [om]: Percentage of organic mater per dry weight (can be missing). \\(BD_{s}\\) [bd]: Bulk density (in g/cm3) of each soil layer. \\(P_{rocks,s}\\) [rfc]: Percentage of rock fragment content (%). Input data should be arranged in a data frame with soil layers in rows and variables in columns (see function defaultSoilParams()). The package provides a function to get soil information from SoilGrids.org (see function soilgridsParams()) that can be helpful to those users lacking soil measurements corresponding to their target forest stands. 2.1.2 Water retention curves Water retention curve of a soil layer \\(s\\) is the relationship between volumetric soil moisture, \\(\\theta_s\\) (in \\(m^3 \\cdot m^{-3}\\) of soil, excluding rock fragments), and the soil water potential, \\(\\Psi_s\\) (in MPa). This curve is characteristic for different types of soil, and is also called the soil moisture characteristic curve. Two water retention curve models are available in the package: Saxton model: In this model, volumetric soil moisture \\(\\theta(\\Psi_s)\\) corresponding to a given water potential \\(\\Psi\\) (in MPa) below \\(\\Psi_{fc}\\) is calculated using: \\[\\begin{equation}\\theta(\\Psi) = (\\Psi/A)^{(1/B)}\\end{equation}\\] where \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) depend on the texture and, if available, organic matter in the soil layer. If organic matter is available, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are calculated from \\(P_{clay}\\), \\(P_{sand}\\) and \\(OM\\) following K. E. Saxton and Rawls (2006). Otherwise, they are calculated from \\(P_{clay}\\) and \\(P_{sand}\\) as indicated in K. Saxton et al. (1986). Volumetric changes between field capacity and saturation are estimated using a linear function. Van Genuchten model: The well known van Genuchten (1980) model is: \\[\\begin{equation}\\theta(\\Psi) = \\theta_{res}+\\frac{\\theta_{sat}-\\theta_{res}}{\\left[1+ (\\alpha \\cdot \\Psi)^n \\right]^{1-1/n}}\\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\theta(\\psi)\\) is the water retention, \\(\\theta_{sat}\\) is the saturated water content, \\(\\theta_{res}\\) is the residual water content, \\(\\alpha\\) is related to the inverse of the air entry pressure (and here has to be expressed in \\(MPa^{-1}\\)), and \\(n\\) is a measure of the pore-size distribution. 2.1.3 Soil initialization Soil initialization is needed to estimate soil hydrological parameters from its physical description. Initialization is done using function soil(), which adds the following information to the physical soil description: \\(P_{macro, s}\\) [macro]: Percentage of macroporosity corresponding to each soil layers. Macroporosity values are calculated for each soil layer using the equations given in Stolf et al. (2011). \\(\\gamma_{soil}\\) [Gsoil]: The maximum daily evaporation from soil(\\(mm \\cdot day^{-1}\\)). \\(\\kappa_{soil}\\) [Ksoil]: Extinction parameter to regulate the amount of water extracted from each soil layer during bare soil evaporation. \\(n_{s}\\), \\(\\alpha_{s}\\), \\(\\theta_{sat,s}\\),\\(\\theta_{res,s}\\) [VG_n, VG_alpha, VG_theta_sat, VG_theta_res]: Parameters of the Van Genuchten-Mualem equations. Parameters of the van Genuchten-Mualem model are estimated from the physical description of the soil using two kinds of pedotransfer functions (see help for soil()): Using the USDA texture classification and the average texture class parameters given by Carsel and Parrish (1988). Directly from the soil texture, organic matter and bulk density, using the pedotransfer functions in B. Tóth et al. (2015). Users can also edit the soil object manually to provide user-defined parameters of the Van Genuchten retention curve. 2.1.4 Water holding capacity and water table depth Soil water holding capacity (\\(V_s\\), in mm) in soil layer \\(s\\) is defined as the volumetric water content at field capacity: \\[\\begin{equation} V_s = d_s\\cdot ((100-P_{rocks,s})/100)\\cdot\\theta_{fc,s} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(d_s\\) is the depth of the soil layer (in mm) and \\(P_{rocks,s}\\) is the percentage of rock fragments. Thus, soil water holding capacity depends on the water retention curve used to determine \\(\\theta_{fc} = \\theta(-0.033)\\). Soil water content at saturation is calculated anagolously, but replacing \\(\\theta_{fc,s}\\) by \\(\\theta_{sat,s}\\). Similarly water content at wilting point (-1.5 MPa) is calculated replacing \\(\\theta_{fc,s}\\) by \\(\\theta_{wp,s}\\) where \\(\\theta_{wp} = \\theta(-1.5)\\). The amount of extractable water is difference between water content at field capacity and a the water content at a minimum water potential, which can be set at wilting point or lower values (by default at -5 MPa). Water table depth (\\(WT\\), in mm) equals soil depth when all soil layers are below field capacity. When some layers are between field capacity and saturation, water table depth is calculated as: \\[\\begin{equation} WT = \\sum_{s}{d_s \\cdot \\min\\left[1,(\\theta_{sat,s} - \\theta(\\Psi_s))/(\\theta_{sat,s}-\\theta_{fc,s})\\right]} \\end{equation}\\] 2.2 Vegetation description Representation of vegetation is not spatially-explicit in medfate (i.e. trees or shrubs do not have explicit coordinates within forest stands). However, differences in tree or shrub size (i.e. height) are explicitly taken into account. The taxonomic identity of plants is also considered, and parameter values need to be provided for each taxonomic entity (but the package could be used with functional groups). This representation is chosen so that package functions can be easily applied to forest plot data, for example from national forest inventories. Vegetation in the stand is described using a set of plant cohorts, in an object of class spwbInput. Each plant cohort \\(i\\) is primarly defined by its species identity (\\(SP_i\\); with R name [SP]). 2.2.1 Aboveground parameters The aboveground structure if each cohort is defined using the following attributes: \\(H_i\\) [H]: Total tree or shrub height (in cm). \\(CR_i\\) [CR]: Crown ratio (i.e. the ratio between crown length and total height). \\(LAI^{live}_i\\) [LAI_live]: (Maximum) leaf area index (one-side leaf area of plants in the cohort per surface area of the stand). \\(LAI^{dead}_i\\) [LAI_dead]: Dead leaf area index (one-side dead leaf area of plants in the cohort per surface area of the stand). \\(LAI^{\\phi}_i\\) [LAI_expanded]: Current expanded leaf area index (one-side expanded leaf area of plants in the cohort per surface area of the stand). All vegetation characteristics stay constant during water balance simulations, although the actual expanded leaf area and dead leaf area may vary is the species is winter deciduous. 2.2.2 Belowground parameters The root system of each plant cohorts is described using the proportion of fine roots in each soil layer: \\(v_{i,s}\\) [V[i,s]]: The proportion of fine roots in each soil layer \\(s\\). The rooting system of each cohort \\(i\\) (i.e. the proportions \\(v_{i,s}\\)) can be defined assuming conic distribution of fine roots (see root_conicDistribution()). In this case, only rooting depth parameter is needed to determine fine root proportions. Alternatively, one can adopt the linear dose response model (Collins and Bras, 2007; Schenk and Jackson, 2002): \\[\\begin{equation} Y_i(z)=\\frac{1}{1+(z/Z_{50,i})^{c_i}} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(Y_i(z)\\) is the cumulative fraction of fine root mass located between surface and depth \\(z\\); \\(Z_{50,i}\\) is the depth above which 50% of the root mass is located; and \\(c_i\\) is a shape parameter related to \\(Z_{50,i}\\) and \\(Z_{95,i}\\) as \\(c_i = 2.94 / \\ln(Z_{50,i} / Z_{95,i})\\) (see root_ldrDistribution()). Figure 2.1: Examples of root density profile according to a conic distribution (left) and the linear dose response model (right). 2.3 Metereological input Weather input data must include variables calculated at the daily scale. Data should be arranged in a data frame with days in rows and variables in columns. The following table indicates the symbols, units, definitions and the variable name in R. Symbol Units R param Description \\(T_{mean}\\) \\(^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\\) MeanTemperature Mean temperature \\(T_{min}\\) \\(^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\\) MinTemperature Minimum temperature \\(T_{max}\\) \\(^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\\) MaxTemperature Maximum temperature \\(RH_{min}\\) % MinRelativeHumidity Minimum relative humidity \\(RH_{max}\\) % MaxRelativeHumidity Maximum relative humidity \\(P\\) \\(L \\cdot m^{-2} = mm\\) Precipitation Precipitation \\(PET\\) \\(L \\cdot m^{-2} = mm\\) PET Potential evapotranspiration, preferably calculated using Penman’s equation \\(Rad\\) \\(MJ \\cdot m^{-2}\\) Radiation Solar radiation after accounting for clouds \\(u\\) \\(m \\cdot s^{-1}\\) WindSpeed Wind speed Not all models require all weather variables, this will be indicated in the corresponding model chapters. For convenience, we recommend meteorological input to be generated using package meteoland (De Cáceres et al. 2018). 2.4 Control parameters Control parameters are a list of parameter values, initialized using function defaultControl(), that the user can modify to change the general behavior of model functions. Not all control parameters are relevant to all model functions Bibliography "]
